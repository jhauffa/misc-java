This is a repository for Java code that I developed for various projects but
ended up not using. Since it might be of use to someone, I am making it
available under a permissive license (MIT license).

In particular, it contains implementations of the following algorithms:
* Enumeration of all cliques of fixed size in a graph (N. Chiba and T.
  Nishizeki: Arboricity and Subgraph Listing Algorithms. SIAM Journal on
  Computing 14(1), p. 210-223, 1985)
* Linear regression subject to the constraint of non-negativity of coefficients
  (NN), summation to one (S1), or both (NNS1), as described in chapter 23 of
  Lawson and Hanson's book "Solving Least Squares Problems" (1995)
* computation of the Gini coefficient (also: Gini index)
* Gandy's algorithm for computing a sequence of bounds to be used as a stopping
  criterium in Monte Carlo hypothesis testing (A. Gandy: Sequential
  Implementation of Monte Carlo Tests with Uniformly Bounded Resampling Risk.
  Journal of the American Statistical Association 104(488), p. 1504-1511, 2009,
  DOI 10.1198/jasa.2009.tm08368)
* fitting a VAR(1) model to (multivariate) time series data
* basic Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA; also: Latent Semantic Indexing, LSI)
